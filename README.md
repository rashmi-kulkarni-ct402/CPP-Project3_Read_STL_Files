# CPP-Project3_Read_STL_Files

Instructions: 
1. Change code from 2D to 3D
2. STL file has triangle points
3. STL file - Facet --> view - normal
4. STL file - Vertex --> Point
5. Read STL file till EOF and write in a text file

Steps:
1. Add a new variable for z-coordinates in Point class
2. Write a function to extract data from STL file and write in a text file (vector to store points & triangles)
3. Plot the 3D shapes in GNU Plot
